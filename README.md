# groupC_assignment2

Project Overview:
In this project , we learnt and implemented the usage of git and github. 
The Team Leader “Vinay Chhabra” created the repository on github.com with the main.go and ReadMe file. Rest of the group was added as collaborators using their github usernames. 
The repository was cloned by all the group members, in order to add their function to the main.go file. 
After having added the function definition and function call, the changes were added and committed(with a message). And the code was pushed to the master branch of repo. 
The final project was ready once every group member pushed their code to the repo.


How to run the application:
In the terminal, change the current directory to the path where the repo has been cloned. Use the command “go run main.go”
